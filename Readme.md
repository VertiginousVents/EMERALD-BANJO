### Team Members
Russell, Marielle, Irene, An Thien

## Task 
Implement a 2D video game.  It can be a well-known game, such as Space Invaders or Pac-man, or a gameof your own invention.  You are required to use the GLUT template provided in class as a starting point.  Ifyou do not wish to use this, you may use a GLUT equivalent library, not a game engine such as Unity.Your game needs to have at least one object that moves autonomously and at least one object controlled bythe player.  You are also required to use textures on your objects and/or backgrounds to make your gamelook better.  Your game should be as close to a finished product as possible.  You should have things likepower-ups, keeping high scores, ability to pause/reset game, ability to save game, etc . . .

## Proposal
The project proposal should contain the following information:
* Team name
* List of team members 
* Project title and brief description 
* Proposed division of labor and time planOnly one proposal per team is required.  

One of the team members should upload the document to the“Assignments” section of CatCourses.

## Presentation 
**Time and Place: Tuesday, May 8, 2018 in COB 120**

Each  team  will  have  5  minutes  to  present  their  project.   The  goal  of  your  presentation  should  be  todemonstrate that all the required features have been implemented.  Each presentation should include a livedemo of the code and each team member should speak.  Please also highlight additional features that youhave implemented in order to impress your peers and instructors.

## Final Report

**Deadline: Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 11:59 pm**

Unlike the proposal, each team member will be required to submit a final report. Some of the sections ofthe report can be shared between team members while others will have to be written individually.

#### These are the common sections, where team members can work together to write.
* Team name, project title and team members 
* A more detailed description of the project.  This should include not only what the app does butalso  how  certain  features  were  implemented.   Code  snippets  should  be  included,  particularly  tohighlight Object-Oriented Programming features that make the code more readable, maintainable,and extendable.

#### Individual sections, that each team member needs to write independently.
* Time Plan and Division of Labor.  Please describe if the original time plan was adhered to, and if not,what changes were necessary.  Also comment on how well the team worked together, and whether thedivision of labor was fair.
* Lessons Learned:  In this section, please write about any interesting lessons you learned while workingon the project.  These do not need to necessarily be about C++ or Object-Oriented Programming,they can be on teamwork, time management skills, or any other aspect related to the project.
* Additional Comments.  This section is optional.  Feel free to write any comment/suggestion/complaintabout the project that has not been covered in the above sections.

The report should be well-written and presented.  The sections should be clearly labelled and should containfull paragraphs.  Please do not write everything in bullet point form and do not use one-liners such as “The team worked well together”.  Instead, write a story that demonstrates this.
